Then, upon request from the user on which crypto they would like detailed. The app shows that daily status of the chosen currency. The description given is a detailed list of the different prices that currency has throughout the past day. 
  
  This app uses HTTParty to retrieve the currencies and prices from the coinbase API. It retrieves these and makes them into objects that the user can recieve from a CLI app.
